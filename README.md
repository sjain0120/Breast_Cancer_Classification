# Breast_Cancer_Classification

# Description:
This repository focuses on building a machine learning-based classification model for breast cancer detection. Leveraging a diverse dataset of biopsy results, the project aims to identify malignant and benign tumors with high accuracy.

The repository showcases a comparison of different classification algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting. Additionally, it explores feature engineering and selection techniques to improve model performance.

# Contents:

**Jupyter Notebooks:** Contains Python notebooks detailing data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.
**Data:** Includes the breast cancer dataset used for training and testing the classifiers.
**Models:** Stores trained machine learning models for future use and reference.

# Objective:
Develop an efficient and interpretable breast cancer classification system for assisting medical practitioners.
Analyze the impact of various machine learning techniques on the model's sensitivity and specificity.
Provide insightful visualizations to aid in understanding the classification results.
